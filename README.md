# Face-mask-detection using CNN
Developed a face mask detection system that identifies whether a person is wearing a mask or not using deep learning techniques.
Utilized a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for effective feature extraction and classification, ensuring high accuracy in mask detection.
Employed OpenCV for real-time face detection and image preprocessing.
Collected and preprocessed a dataset of images, including both masked and unmasked faces, to train and validate the model.
